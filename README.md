# InfoLabelTweaks

Adds additional information to GD's Info Label, or compacts portions of it. (Formerly part of ErysEdits.)

*Note: As of writing, not all features are available across all platforms. Install the mod from the [Geode index](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/raydeeux.infolabeltweaks) to confirm.*

*Windows users: If [Minecraftify](https://geode-sdk.org/mod/zalphalaneous.minecraftify) is loaded, it will hide the Info Label in favor of its own info label layout resembling Minecraft's F3 menu. This mod will not run if Minecraftify is loaded.*

Extra information displayed includes:
* Player Status
* Level Traits
* Camera Properties
* Geode Loader Info
